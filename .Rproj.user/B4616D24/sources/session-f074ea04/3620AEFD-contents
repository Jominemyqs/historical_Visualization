## What are the risks and benefits?
**Risks:** There are no known risks beyond those of everyday computer use. You may experience mild eye strain from looking at charts on a screen.

**Benefits:** You will contribute to research that helps improve data visualization design. There are no direct benefits to you.

## Will my information be kept confidential?
**Yes.** Your responses will be completely anonymous. We do not collect names, email addresses, or other identifying information. Data will be stored securely on university servers and retained for 3 years as required by research standards.
