## Evaluation Framework Overview

This framework implements the two-track assessment approach outlined in the project proposal:

1. **Objective Metrics**: Data-ink ratio, visual channel count, Shannon entropy
2. **Subjective Performance**: Accuracy, response time, perceived workload (NASA-TLX)

### Research Questions
1. How do original graphics perform on objective efficiency measures?
2. Do contemporary viewers extract information as accurately/quickly from historical vs modern designs?  
3. Which design elements aid or hinder interpretation?

```

## Part I: Objective Metrics Assessment

### 1.1 Data-Ink Ratio Calculation

Following Tufte's definition: Data-Ink Ratio = (Data-Ink) / (Total Ink Used)

```{r data-ink-framework, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Framework for calculating data-ink ratios
calculate_data_ink_ratio <- function(chart_type, elements) {
  # Define what counts as "data ink" vs "non-data ink" for each chart type
  
  data_ink_elements <- list(
    nightingale_historical = c("wedge_areas", "color_encoding", "radial_scale"),
    nightingale_modern_bars = c("bar_heights", "color_encoding", "axis_scale"),
    nightingale_modern_heatmap = c("tile_colors", "position_encoding"),
    
    playfair_historical = c("line_paths", "area_fills", "data_points"),
    playfair_modern_dual = c("line_paths", "ribbon_area", "data_points"),
    playfair_modern_slope = c("line_segments", "data_points", "value_labels"),
    
    minard_historical = c("flow_widths", "path_geometry", "color_encoding", "temp_line"),
    minard_modern_lines = c("line_paths", "data_points", "facet_encoding"),
    minard_modern_scatter = c("point_positions", "regression_line", "confidence_band")
  )
  
  non_data_ink_elements <- list(
    common = c("titles", "legends", "axis_labels", "grid_lines", "backgrounds", "annotations"),
    decorative = c("borders", "drop_shadows", "gradients", "artistic_elements")
  )
  
  # This would be implemented with actual pixel analysis or element counting
  # For now, providing the conceptual framework
  
  return(list(
    chart_type = chart_type,
    data_elements = data_ink_elements[[chart_type]],
    non_data_elements = non_data_ink_elements,
    ratio_calculation = "Requires pixel-level analysis or element inventory"
  ))
}

# Example assessment for all chart types
chart_types <- c(
  "nightingale_historical", "nightingale_modern_bars", "nightingale_modern_heatmap",
  "playfair_historical", "playfair_modern_dual", "playfair_modern_slope", 
  "minard_historical", "minard_modern_lines", "minard_modern_scatter"
)

data_ink_assessment <- map_dfr(chart_types, ~{
  assessment <- calculate_data_ink_ratio(.x, NULL)
  tibble(
    chart_type = .x,
    era = if_else(str_detect(.x, "historical"), "Historical", "Modern"),
    dataset = case_when(

      str_detect(.x, "playfair") ~ "Playfair", 
      str_detect(.x, "minard") ~ "Minard"
    )
  )
})

kable(data_ink_assessment, caption = "Chart Types for Data-Ink Ratio Analysis")
```

### 1.2 Visual Channel Inventory

Count and categorize the visual channels used in each visualization.

```{r visual-channels, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Visual encoding channels taxonomy (Cleveland & McGill hierarchy)

  # Where p(x) is probability of each visual state
  
  # This requires actual data analysis of:
  # - Color usage distribution
  # - Position/size value distributions  
  # - Shape/texture variety
  # - Overall visual complexity
  
  return("Requires implementation with actual chart data")
}

## Summary

This evaluation framework provides:

1. **â Objective Metrics**: Data-ink ratio, visual channels, Shannon entropy
2. **â Subjective Measures**: Accuracy, timing, NASA-TLX workload  
3. **â Experimental Design**: Randomization, counterbalancing, sample size
4. **â Statistical Plan**: Mixed-effects models with planned contrasts
5. **â Implementation Guide**: Technical requirements and timeline

The framework is designed to rigorously test whether 19th-century visualization innovations still communicate effectively to contemporary viewers, providing evidence for or against the enduring value of historical design choices.
